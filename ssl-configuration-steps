SSL Configuration:

#download certbot
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto

#make it an executable file
chmod a+x certbot-auto

#Before generating the certificate make it sure that you have made an entry in virtual host with appropriate IP & Domain name
vim /etc/hosts

#Ex. we have added following line 
52.44.91.205    dev.mobelisk.net

#then, create ther certificate[goto the foldr where certbot is downloaded]
sudo ./certbot-auto --debug -v --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory certonly -d dev.mobelisk.net

#then it will ask admin email ID. If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through e-mails sent to amit.tidke@e-zest.in(which is admin email you provided).

#then, it will ask:
How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Apache Web Server plugin - Beta (apache)
2: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
3: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#go with 2nd option

#next, thing it will ask:
Select the webroot for dev.mobelisk.net[your domain name]:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Enter a new webroot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Enter 1 and in the next step path of root directory for specific
#like in this case we had entered /var/www/html/dynamic/

#Boom!! Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been generated & saved @etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainname/

##Then you have to enable HTTPS:
#you have to modify ssl.conf files
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Set SSLCertificateFile to your Certificate path (/etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_WEBSITE_HERE/cert.pem).
Set SSLCertificateKeyFile to your Private Key path (etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_WEBSITE_HERE/privkey.pem).
Set SSLCertificateChainFile to your Full Chain path (etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_WEBSITE_HERE/fullchain.pem).

#Restart apache
sudo service httpd restart

Done!!! you can go ahead to test the links

##Setup SSL Auto-renew
If you want to get rid off the renewal of SSL you can add single line in cron jobs:
0 1,13 * * * /home/ec2-user/certbot-auto renew 



enable ssl 
sudo a2enmod ssl
